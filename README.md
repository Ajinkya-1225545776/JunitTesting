In the given urinal problem we have to find out maximum urinals that are free. 
For example if first urinal is full then the next has to be empty, and the next to empty one can be used again.
Here we find out maximum number of urinals that are empty in such a way that they are to be used using above rule.
If two urinals are used at a time "-1" is printed as output.
